# UnityToolbar
Simple Implementation Of How The Awesome Plugin [*UnityToolbar Extender*](https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender)

## What It Does
This Implementation Includes A Few Scripts Which Makes You Able To Choose One Scene To Be Your *"PreLoadScene"*
A Scene Where You Include Dependencies That Needs To Be Loaded At Start (Something A Lot Of Games Will Need).

In Just Before Pressing The Button
